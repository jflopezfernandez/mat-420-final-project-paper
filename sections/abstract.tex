    AAs metropolitan areas around the United States continue to expand, interactions between humans and  Canada  geese  have  grown  increasingly  tempestuous,  particularly  during  the  mating  season. Canada geese population levels are straining local government infrastructures and resulting in property damage potentially costing millions of dollars a year.  This report outlines the present situation, contextualizes the problem at hand, and delineates a proposed solution to mitigate the negative effects of the Canada geese populations, while respectingand promoting a healthy and endosymbiotic relationship with these animals, which are beloved by many all across the United States.
